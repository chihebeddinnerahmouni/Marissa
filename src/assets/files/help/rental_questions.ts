    answer: `
<p class='font-bold text-red-200'>It's super easy! Whether you're looking for a kayak or a yacht, Getmyboat has you covered.</p>
<p>Find a watercraft:</p>
<p>Start browsing our listings by using the search bar on our homepage. Enter where you want to go, the date, and number of passengers. Once you submit your search, our listings will be displayed for you to browse. If you wish to filter the search results further, you may use our filters.</p>
<p>Hint: advanced filters will help a lot too!</p>
<p>Send your inquiry:</p>
<p>When you find a watercraft you like, you may send an inquiry directly to the owner by clicking "Send Inquiry". You will be asked a few simple questions that will help the owner price your trip. Once you submit the inquiry, it will be sent directly to the boat owner or manager for them to respond.</p>
<p>The owner will either send you an offer with customized pricing for your request which you can accept to confirm the booking, or they may decline your inquiry if they cannot accommodate your trip.</p>
<p>Make your payment:</p>
<p>You will be asked for full payment via credit card when you accept an owner's offer. Please be sure to review the owner's cancellation and refund policies before you accept a booking if there's a chance you may have to cancel. Please note Getmyboat service fees are non-refundable.</p>
<p>Enjoy your trip:</p>
<p>Once you've paid, you'll be good to go. At that point, you'll receive a confirmation email of your booking and you may contact the owner directly via phone or email if preferred (contact info cannot be shared until an offer is accepted).</p>
<p>Once your trip is completed, you may leave a review about your experience!</p>
